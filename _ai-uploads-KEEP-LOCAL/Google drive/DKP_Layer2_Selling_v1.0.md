# Diamond Knowledge Pack (DKP) – Layer 2  
## Selling (v1.0)

### Overview
Selling is the sixth and final stage in the diamond recovery pipeline, following **Sorting**. At this stage, diamonds are transferred from operational custody into commercial channels, where they are sold either directly to clients, through auctions, or via long-term contracts.  

This stage is critical from both a **financial security** and **compliance** perspective. The value of diamonds increases dramatically once classified and graded, making this point highly sensitive to fraud, money laundering, and reputational risks.

### Key Functions in Selling
1. **Custody Transfer from Sorting**  
   - Diamonds arrive sealed and reconciled from the sorting function.  
   - Custody records must be verified before sales processing begins.  

2. **Valuation Confirmation**  
   - Independent valuation ensures transparency and fairness.  
   - Cross-check against sorting records to detect discrepancies.  

3. **Sales Channels**  
   - **Long-term contracts** with selected sightholders or clients.  
   - **Auctions** or tenders for competitive market pricing.  
   - **Spot sales** for immediate liquidity needs.  

4. **Compliance & Certification**  
   - Kimberley Process Certification (KPC) to ensure conflict-free sourcing.  
   - Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) checks.  

5. **Revenue Collection & Reconciliation**  
   - Proceeds are collected, reconciled, and recorded against inventory.  
   - Financial reporting ensures traceability and accountability.

### Security & Loss-Prevention Considerations
- **Fraud Risks**: Inflated valuations, client collusion, or under-reporting sales.  
- **Custody Chain**: Strict controls must remain in place until the point of sale.  
- **Compliance Gaps**: Missing or falsified KPC documents can expose organizations to sanctions.  
- **Reputation Risk**: Any breach in ethical standards undermines trust with clients and regulators.  
- **Audit & Oversight**: Independent oversight bodies and internal audit must validate transactions.

### Integration with Value Chain
Selling closes the diamond recovery value chain. It provides financial realization for upstream and midstream activities. Any weaknesses here compromise not only revenue but also the legitimacy of the entire pipeline.
