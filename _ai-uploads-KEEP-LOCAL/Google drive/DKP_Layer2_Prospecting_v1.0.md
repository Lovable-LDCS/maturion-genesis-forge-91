# Diamond Knowledge Pack (DKP) – Layer 2  
## Prospecting (v1.0)

### Overview
Prospecting is the second stage in the diamond recovery pipeline, following **Exploration** and preceding **Mining**. At this stage, potential diamond-bearing deposits identified during exploration are examined more closely to determine whether commercial mining is viable.  

Prospecting involves sampling, testing, and evaluating deposits to establish the quality, quantity, and economic potential of diamonds present. This stage provides the critical **go/no-go decision** for investment in mining operations.

### Key Functions in Prospecting
1. **Geological Sampling**  
   - Collection of bulk samples from kimberlite pipes, alluvial deposits, or other host rock formations.  
   - Samples are carefully documented, transported, and processed for diamond content.  

2. **Bulk Testing & Pilot Plants**  
   - Small-scale processing facilities recover diamonds from bulk samples.  
   - Provides data on grade (carats per tonne), size distribution, and diamond quality.  

3. **Economic Feasibility Analysis**  
   - Determines whether the deposit can be mined profitably.  
   - Involves assessing infrastructure, costs, environmental and social factors.  

4. **Environmental & Community Assessments**  
   - Early-stage environmental impact studies and community consultations.  
   - Identifies potential risks, obligations, and mitigation strategies.  

5. **Security Controls During Prospecting**  
   - Diamonds recovered during sampling are high-value and low-volume.  
   - Requires strict custody, reconciliation, and audit processes despite small scale.

### Security & Loss-Prevention Considerations
- **Sampling Risks**: High-value stones in small samples can be easily concealed or stolen.  
- **Chain of Custody**: Every sample and recovered diamond must be logged, sealed, and reconciled.  
- **Pilot Plant Vulnerabilities**: Even temporary facilities must implement dual-control protocols and surveillance.  
- **Data Integrity**: Prospecting results must be tamper-proof to ensure accurate feasibility studies and prevent fraud.

### Integration with Value Chain
Prospecting builds on **Exploration data** and determines whether **Mining** should commence. Weaknesses here can lead to false investment decisions, financial loss, or reputational damage. A robust prospecting process provides confidence for downstream activities.
