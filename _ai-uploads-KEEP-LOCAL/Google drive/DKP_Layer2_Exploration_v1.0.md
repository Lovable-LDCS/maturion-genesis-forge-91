# Diamond Recovery Pipeline — Layer 2: Exploration (v1.0)

**Document Type:** Diamond Knowledge Pack — Function Descriptor  
**Domains:** Process Integrity (primary), Leadership & Governance (supporting)  
**Visibility:** All Users  
**Tags:** industry:diamond, pipeline-layer:2, exploration, geology, prospecting, custody, loss-prevention, reconciliation, insider-threat  

**AI Backoffice Description:**  
High-level descriptor of the **Exploration** function in the diamond recovery value chain. Defines the objectives, key assets, systems used, custody/hand-off points, vulnerabilities, and loss-prevention measures. Designed as the first component document in Layer 2, feeding into deeper Layer 3 equipment/machinery breakdowns.

---

## 1) Purpose & Audience
Provide a focused descriptor of the **Exploration stage** so security teams, supervisors, and governance leads understand what is at risk before mining begins, and how poor controls here can cascade into losses downstream.  

**Audience:** Exploration geologists, Security Officers, Governance & Compliance teams, Strategic Planning, Audit/Assurance.

---

## 2) Scope & Assumptions
- Applies to **upstream exploration activities** (pre-mining).  
- Covers geological modelling, sampling, and prospecting as inputs into mine planning.  
- Excludes machinery detail (to be addressed in Layer 3).  
- Assumes operations are governed under formal approval processes and require **traceability of data custody**.

## 3) Exploration Function — Descriptor

- **Objective:** Define diamondiferous ore zones, grade expectations, and size distribution to guide prospecting and mine planning.  
- **Key Assets:** Geological model, sampling data, grade/valuation forecasts, drill core samples, geophysical records.  
- **Typical Systems:** Core logging, microdiamond analysis, geostatistical modelling, GIS databases.  
- **Handoffs/Custody:**  
  - Geological models → Mine Planning (formal sign-off required).  
  - Sample custody → Laboratory / Assay facilities (chain-of-custody records).  
- **Primary Loss Modes:**  
  - Data tampering or manipulation of model inputs.  
  - Missing or unverified custody of core samples.  
  - Expectation gaps causing misaligned KPIs and undetected downstream losses.  
- **Threats:**  
  - Insider manipulation of grade forecasts.  
  - Collusion with external laboratories.  
  - Over-optimistic reporting masking systemic under-recovery.

---

## 4) Oversight & Assurance Signals
- **Sample Integrity:** Chain-of-custody logs for drill cores and assay results.  
- **Model Approval:** Executive/geology sign-off with version control.  
- **Variance Checks:** Periodic reconciliation of forecast grades vs. production grades.  
- **Independent Review:** External audit of geological model assumptions.  
- **Training & SoD:** Separation between data collection, model creation, and approval.

---

## 5) Interfaces to Other Domains
- **Leadership & Governance:** Approval workflows, executive attestations, model change logs.  
- **People & Culture:** Insider threat awareness in exploration teams, whistleblower mechanisms.  
- **Process Integrity:** Links directly into mine planning; poor exploration integrity undermines all downstream controls.  
- **Proof it Works:** Independent audits, variance tracking, immutable record storage.

---

## 6) Glossary (selected)
- **Geological Model:** A data-driven representation of orebody characteristics.  
- **Microdiamond Analysis:** Laboratory test method to infer grade from small samples.  
- **GIS:** Geographic Information System for spatial data management.  
- **Chain of Custody:** Documented sequence of sample handling and transfer.

---

## 7) Change Log
- **v1.0** — Initial descriptor for Exploration (Layer 2).
