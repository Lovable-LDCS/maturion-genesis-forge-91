## 1) Purpose
What this equipment does in the value chain and why it matters for recovery efficiency and security.

## 2) Working Mechanism — Diamond Properties Exploited
- Primary principle (e.g., density, luminescence, hydrophobicity/oleophilicity, hardness, conductivity).  
- How the machine uses that property to separate/identify diamonds.  
- Key operating parameters (set-points, ranges, tolerances).

## 3) Operating Envelope
- Inputs (feed spec, PSD, moisture, contamination limits).  
- Outputs (expected concentrate/waste specs).  
- Throughput & availability expectations.

## 4) Non‑Malicious Vulnerabilities (Failure Modes)
- Miscalibration, wear, fouling, misalignment, media contamination, sensor drift, software bugs.  
- Effect on capture/recovery rates.  
- Detection signals (alarms, trends, KPIs that move).

## 5) Malicious Vulnerabilities (Tamper/Bypass)
- Intentional parameter changes, sensor masking, camera blinding, disabling ejectors, bypass routes, screen cuts, rogue magnets, sample substitution.  
- Insider roles with opportunity/access.

## 6) Diamond Loss Pathways
- Where diamonds can physically leave the control envelope (spillage, carry-over to waste, breakage, tramp iron traps, sump losses, screen oversize bypass).

## 7) Controls & Rectification
- Engineering controls (interlocks, guards, seals, redundant sensors).  
- Procedural controls (dual presence, SoD, checklists, sign-offs).  
- Monitoring/telemetry (CCTV, black-screen review, trend dashboards).  
- Rectification playbook (how to restore settings, clean, recalibrate, test).

## 8) Custody, Audit & Evidence
- Handoffs and sealed containers/lines.  
- What is logged (who/what/when/where).  
- Evidence to collect after incidents (samples, logs, video, configurations).

## 9) KPIs & Assurance Tests
- Recovery %, mass balance, variance limits.  
- Scheduled test routines (e.g., tracer stones, density checks, calibration stones).  
- Acceptance criteria for “in control”.

## 10) Interfaces
- Upstream equipment dependencies and downstream impacts of failure.  
- Communication with Dispatch/Control Room/Sorting.

## 11) Change Log
- v1.0 — Initial template.
