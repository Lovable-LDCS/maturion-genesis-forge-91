# Diamond Recovery Pipeline — Layer 2: Mining (v1.0)

**Document Type:** Diamond Knowledge Pack — Function Descriptor  
**Domains:** Process Integrity (primary), Protection (supporting)  
**Visibility:** All Users  
**Tags:** industry:diamond, pipeline-layer:2, mining, drill-blast-haul, ore-delivery, custody, loss-prevention, reconciliation, insider-threat  

**AI Backoffice Description:**  
High-level descriptor of the **Mining** function in the diamond recovery value chain. Defines objectives, key assets, custody/hand-offs, vulnerabilities, and threats. Designed as part of Layer 2 documents, providing context for later Layer 3 breakdowns of mining equipment and operational risks.

---

## 1) Purpose & Audience
Provide a clear descriptor of the **Mining stage** — where ore is extracted, moved, and delivered to processing. This stage is central to both **value creation** and **loss vulnerability**.  

**Audience:** Mining engineers, Dispatch supervisors, Security officers, Process integrity teams, Governance & Audit stakeholders.

---

## 2) Scope & Assumptions
- Covers drill, blast, load, and haul activities through to delivery at ROM stockpiles.  
- Excludes crushing/plant operations (covered in Processing).  
- Assumes use of modern fleet management and weighbridge systems.  
- Custody of ore must be **traceable** from pit to plant feed.  

---

## 3) Mining Function — Descriptor
- **Objective:** Extract and deliver ore to specification and plan, ensuring accountability and accurate records.  
- **Key Assets:** Blasting patterns, ore blocks, trucks, haulage logs, weighbridge data.  
- **Typical Systems:** Fleet management systems (FMS), weighbridges, blasting control software, GPS tracking.  
- **Handoffs/Custody:**  
  - Pit face → Truck load (recorded in FMS).  
  - Truck → ROM stockpile (logged at weighbridge and dispatch).  
- **Primary Loss Modes:**  
  - Bypassing ore through dilution or mis-routing.  
  - Unlogged scavenging or small-scale theft.  
  - Spillage during haul not recovered.  
- **Threats:**  
  - Collusion to divert or downgrade ore.  
  - Tampering with weighbridge/dispatch records.  
  - Manipulation of fleet tracking systems.  

---

## 4) Oversight & Assurance Signals
- **Dispatch Logs:** Must reconcile with weighbridge and FMS records daily.  
- **Spillage Recovery:** Documented cleanup with independent verification.  
- **Grade Reconciliation:** Compare block model vs. delivered ore grades.  
- **CCTV & Black-Screen Monitoring:** ROM entries/exits, truck loads, weighbridge gates.  
- **SoD:** Separate teams for blasting, hauling, and logging.  

---

## 5) Interfaces to Other Domains
- **Leadership & Governance:** Approval of mine plans, monitoring of variance reporting.  
- **People & Culture:** Training on spillage recovery, insider threat mitigation.  
- **Process Integrity:** Direct input into crushing/processing mass-balance; errors here cascade downstream.  
- **Protection:** Escort protocols, GPS monitoring, secure weighbridge operations.  
- **Proof it Works:** Incident investigations, reconciliation audits, variance closure.  

---

## 6) Glossary (selected)
- **FMS:** Fleet Management System for dispatch and haul tracking.  
- **ROM Stockpile:** Run-of-Mine stockpile where extracted ore is held before processing.  
- **Black-Screen Monitoring:** Independent surveillance where operators cannot see live video feeds, but assurance teams can review.  
- **Variance:** The difference between expected and actual ore/grade delivered.  

---

## 7) Change Log
- **v1.0** — Initial descriptor for Mining (Layer 2).
