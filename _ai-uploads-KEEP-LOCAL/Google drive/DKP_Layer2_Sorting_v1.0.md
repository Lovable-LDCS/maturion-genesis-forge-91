# Diamond Knowledge Pack (DKP) – Layer 2  
## Sorting (v1.0)

### Overview
Sorting is the fifth stage in the diamond recovery pipeline, following **Processing**. At this stage, the concentrated diamond-bearing material recovered from processing plants is carefully examined, categorized, and valued. Sorting represents the first step in transitioning from operational recovery to commercial valuation and trade preparation.

This stage is highly sensitive from a **security and integrity perspective**. Human involvement increases the risk of theft, substitution, or collusion. Strict custody and reconciliation procedures are therefore paramount.

### Key Functions in Sorting
1. **Receipt & Custody Transfer**  
   - Diamonds are received from the recovery plant under dual control.  
   - Chain of custody must be validated before opening sealed containers.  

2. **Initial Examination & Weighing**  
   - Parcels are weighed, counted, and reconciled against processing plant outputs.  
   - Discrepancies must be logged and investigated immediately.  

3. **Classification & Grading**  
   - Diamonds are sorted by size, shape, color, clarity, and quality.  
   - Specialized graders or automated tools may be used.  

4. **Valuation & Packaging**  
   - Parcels are valued for commercial or internal accounting purposes.  
   - Packaging and sealing under dual-control protocols is enforced.  

5. **Transfer to Sales or Storage**  
   - Sorted parcels are handed to the next value chain stage (**Selling**) or stored securely pending shipment.  
   - Custody is documented at every transfer point.

### Security & Loss-Prevention Considerations
- **Custody Break Risks**: Each transfer point introduces opportunities for substitution or pilferage.  
- **Insider Collusion**: Sorting is people-intensive, requiring layered supervision and monitoring.  
- **Reconciliation**: Accurate reconciliation between recovery output and sorting intake is vital.  
- **Surveillance**: Full coverage of sorting rooms (including blind spot elimination and black-screen AI monitoring).  
- **Audit Trail**: Every parcel movement, from opening to resealing, must be logged and reviewable.

### Integration with Value Chain
Sorting bridges the **Processing (upstream)** and **Selling (downstream)** stages. The credibility of diamond valuation depends on the integrity of sorting. Weaknesses here undermine confidence in both recovery efficiency and eventual sales transactions.
