# Diamond Knowledge Pack (DKP) – Layer 2  
## Processing (v1.0)

### Overview
Processing is the fourth stage in the diamond recovery pipeline, following **Mining**. At this stage, the mined ore containing potential diamondiferous material is delivered to specialized facilities where mechanical, chemical, and optical processes are applied to separate diamonds from host rock and other minerals.

Processing plays a **critical role in both efficiency and security**. Because diamonds are small, high-value items, recovery processes are designed to maximize capture rates while minimizing opportunities for loss, theft, or tampering. This stage represents one of the highest risk environments for diamond loss, both from process inefficiencies and insider threat activity.

### Key Functions in Processing
1. **Crushing & Comminution**  
   - Large ore pieces are broken down into smaller fragments to liberate diamond-bearing material.  
   - Critical control: balancing particle size to avoid damaging diamonds while ensuring liberation.

2. **Dense Media Separation (DMS)**  
   - Ore particles are separated using a slurry of precise density.  
   - Diamonds, being denser, sink while lighter material floats.  
   - Control risks: density miscalibration or intentional tampering.

3. **X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) & Laser Sorting**  
   - Automated systems detect and separate diamonds based on luminescence and optical properties.  
   - Security concern: bypassing, tampering, or disabling scanners.

4. **Recovery Plant & Concentration Circuits**  
   - Diamonds are concentrated into progressively smaller, higher-grade parcels.  
   - Custody controls: dual-person presence, reconciliation between shifts, audit logging.

5. **Final Recovery & Transfer to Sorting**  
   - Concentrated diamond material is transferred under controlled custody to the **Sorting** stage.  
   - At this transfer point, **chain of custody protocols** are critical.

### Security & Loss-Prevention Considerations
- **Process Vulnerabilities**: Incorrect settings or calibration can deliberately or accidentally reduce recovery rates.  
- **Insider Threats**: Employees with access to sensitive areas (e.g., recovery plant operators) pose high risks.  
- **Reconciliation**: Accurate measurement and reconciliation between input (tonnes processed) and output (carats recovered) is essential.  
- **Surveillance & Monitoring**: Camera coverage, black-screen AI monitoring, and remote assurance reduce opportunity for collusion.  
- **Technology Integrity**: Automated systems (XRF, laser sorters) must be tested regularly to ensure functionality and prevent sabotage.

### Integration with Value Chain
Processing bridges **Mining (upstream)** and **Sorting (midstream)**. The integrity of this stage directly determines the effectiveness of subsequent stages. Any loss or inefficiency here compounds downstream and undermines overall system credibility.
