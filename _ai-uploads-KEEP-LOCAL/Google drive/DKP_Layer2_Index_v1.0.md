# Diamond Knowledge Pack (DKP) – Layer 2  
## Index of Diamond Recovery Pipeline Components

This index provides an overview of the six Layer 2 documents in the **Diamond Recovery Pipeline**. Each component builds on the Layer 1 overview and leads into more detailed Layer 3 (equipment/machinery) and Layer 4 (ancillary equipment) levels.

### Integration Note
Each Layer 2 document serves as a **high-level descriptor** of its function in the diamond recovery value chain. Together they provide a structured framework for drilling down into:  
- **Layer 3** → Equipment and machinery per function  
- **Layer 4** → Ancillary equipment and supporting processes
