Maturion Knowledge File: Control Ownership and Accountability Model

Category: Governance – Role Clarity and Oversight

Tags: Control Ownership, Accountability, Governance, Role Assignment, Escalation, Responsibility Mapping

Purpose: Ensures every control has a clearly assigned owner, with role clarity and escalation logic.

Roles:
- Designers (define control)
- Operators (maintain control)
- Reviewers (assess control)
- Approvers (authorize changes)

Assignment Logic:
- Every control must be linked to role, function, accountability chain.
- AI flags orphaned or ambiguously owned controls.
