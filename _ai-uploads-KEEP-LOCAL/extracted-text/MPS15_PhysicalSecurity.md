Description:
Minimum Performance Standard for Physical Security. Defines the intent, required actions, and guidance for establishing risk-based, layered physical security measures that prioritise technology-led controls, integrate human-based processes as supportive layers, and create data-rich environments for monitoring, analysis, and continuous improvement. Aligns with ASIS Physical Asset Protection Standards and ISO 27001 Physical Security requirements to ensure security systems are designed to deter, detect, delay, and respond to threats while supporting resilience and safety.
