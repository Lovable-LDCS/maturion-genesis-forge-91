Maturion Criteria Engine Policy

Defines how Maturion generates, validates, and adapts Minimum Performance Standard (MPS) criteria.

Core Generation Rules:
• Must be evidence-first (Annex 2 style)
• Follow singular structure: Evidence → Noun → Context
• Avoid compound logic and vague statements

Tailoring Logic:
• Incorporates organization name or role if needed
• Adjusts phrasing based on industry terminology
• Follows role-based specificity

Rewrite and Feedback Loop:
• Maturion accepts rejections and rewrites
• Improves model accuracy over time
• Learns sector nuances
