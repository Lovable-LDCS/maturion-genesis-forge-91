Diamond Resilience & Incident Response Control

Domain: Proof it Works

Tags: resilience, incident response, drills, assurance testing

Description:
Industry-specific resilience and incident response model for diamond operations. Prioritizes evidence that controls work under stress: drills, fail-safe tests, red-team checks, and measured recovery (MTTD/MTTR). Aligns post-incident learning to permanent control improvements.
