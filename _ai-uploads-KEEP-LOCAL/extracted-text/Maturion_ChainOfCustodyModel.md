Tags: Chain of Custody, Asset Transfer, Sign-Off Protocols, Control Points, Evidence Integrity, Custody Breach

Purpose: Tracks asset movement through custody, detects weak handovers, enforces accountability.

Key Components:

2. Custody Point Logic — timestamps, roles, reconciliation at every handover.
3. Digital & Physical Traceability — barcodes, RFID, logs, surveillance, e-signatures.
4. Dual Custody Models — segregation, staggered handovers, witness protocols.
5. Breach Indicators — missing sign-offs, anomalies, custody gaps.
