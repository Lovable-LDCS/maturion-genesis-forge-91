Maturion Knowledge File: Control Lifecycle Tagging Model

Category: Metadata Structure – Control Status and Stage

Tags: Control Lifecycle, Tagging, Status Tracking, Stage Mapping, AI Reasoning Support, Review Scheduling

Purpose: Allows Maturion to tag and track each control based on its lifecycle stage, providing better reasoning, audit visibility, and decision-making.

Lifecycle Stages:
- Planned
- Designed
- Implemented
- Validated
- Operational
- Under Review
- Retired

AI Behavior:
- Planned → design prompts
- Implemented → validation checklist
- Operational → monitor/test
- Retired → archive for audit

Governance Alignment:
- Ownership roles assigned per stage (design, implementation, review).
- Escalation if controls stagnate or drift.
