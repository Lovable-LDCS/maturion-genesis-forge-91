Maturion Knowledge File: Control Effectiveness Model

Category: Evaluation Framework – Control Maturity

Tags: Control Evaluation, Effectiveness, Assurance Level, Audit Criteria, Weak Control Detection, Risk Exposure

Purpose: Enables Maturion to assess the real-world performance, credibility, and coverage of controls, including their ability to withstand failure, manipulation, and scrutiny.

Key Components:
1. Definition of Control Effectiveness — ability of a control to reliably reduce risk under real-world conditions.
2. Effectiveness Scoring Dimensions — design quality, implementation fidelity, operational performance, behavioral adoption, audit readiness.
3. High-Risk Weakness Patterns — assumed compliance, unowned controls, infrequent review, silent failures.
4. Field-Level Testing Prompts — spot checks, drills, anomaly scenarios, unannounced audits.
5. Control Workarounds and Credibility Gaps — bypassing, workarounds, false positives/negatives.
6. Alignment to Risk Posture — match sensitivity, threat exposure, ROI balance.
7. AI Behavior in Effectiveness Evaluation — cross-domain reasoning, pattern detection, learning from incidents.
8. Integration with Evidence and MPS — mapped to MPS 6, 10, 23.
