Maturion Strategy & Core System Logic

Outlines Maturion’s internal watchdog logic, owner alerts, and core AI duties.

Watchdog Mode:
• Monitors AI behavior for drift or outdated rules
• Detects when backoffice logic is misaligned with real-time events
• Flags anomalies in audit criteria or user patterns

Owner Notifications:
• Email, Slack, or WhatsApp
• Alerts sent for:
   - New international standards
   - Expired procedures detected in client repositories
   - Feature improvement suggestions

Continuous Improvement Mandate:
• AI is allowed to correct itself internally (no UI/UX changes)
• All external-facing changes must go through admin (Johan, Lovable, GPT)
