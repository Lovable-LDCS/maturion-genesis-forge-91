Category: Subject Knowledge – Security Philosophy

Tags: Defense in Depth, Weakest Link, Resilience, Chain of Custody, Control Design, Governance, Continuous Improvement

Purpose: Equips Maturion with foundational principles to reason about the purpose, architecture, layering, and assurance of security controls.

Principles:
1. Weakest-Link Problem — single-point-of-failure detection, cross-functional mapping.
2. Security = Risk Reduction — always link control to risk.
3. Trade-Off Awareness — balance between assurance and usability.
4. Defense-in-Depth — mutually reinforcing control layers (physical, technical, operational, governance).
5. Chain of Custody — enforce accountability across flows.
6. Aligning Controls with Business Risk — proportionality and integration.
7. Resilience through Control Design — redundancy, automated fallback, early-warning indicators.
8. Governance of Security Controls — ownership, validation, metrics, periodic review.
9. Continuous Improvement — learning from incidents and feedback loops.
10. Human Element — culture, compliance, integrity.
11. Integration — mapped to MPS 3, 5, 10, 15, 22.
