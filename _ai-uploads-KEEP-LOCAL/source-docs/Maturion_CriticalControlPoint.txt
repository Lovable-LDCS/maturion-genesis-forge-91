Maturion Knowledge File: Critical Control Point Model

Category: Structural Frameworks – Risk-Based Control Prioritization

Tags: Critical Controls, Control Mapping, Loss Points, Risk Nodes, Priority Zones, Escalation Design

Purpose: Helps Maturion identify and manage high-impact control points in any process or environment where failure is likely to result in significant loss, incident, or breach.

Key Components:
1. What Is a CCP? — stage/zone where loss or breach most likely, controls applied to prevent or detect.
2. Identification Logic — risk concentration, incident history, complexity, dependency patterns.
3. CCP Control Layering — redundant controls, multi-layer protection, automated alerts.
4. Escalation & Monitoring — tiered response, immediate alerting, governance audit trails.
5. Governance — explicit CCP designation, ownership, periodic reviews, drills.
6. Failure Consequence Mapping — estimated loss, downtime, RTO, reputational impact.
7. CCP Training — risk awareness, drills, reinforcement.
8. Real-Time Monitoring — AI-driven scores, sensors, anomaly detection.
9. MPS Linkages — mapped to MPS 6, 10, 15, 22, 23.
10. Continuous Re-Evaluation — reassessment, reprioritization, performance monitoring.
