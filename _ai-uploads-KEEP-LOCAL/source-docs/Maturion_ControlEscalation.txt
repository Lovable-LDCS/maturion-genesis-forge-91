Maturion Knowledge File: Control Escalation Model

Category: Control Environment – Incident Response and Alerting

Tags: Escalation, Trigger Thresholds, Alert Routing, Supervisory Oversight, Tiered Response, Incident Activation

Purpose: Equips Maturion with the logic to escalate alerts, deviations, and anomalies through structured, role-based pathways to ensure timely intervention and containment.

Key Components:
1. What Is Escalation? — moving an alert/decision to higher authority once thresholds are met.
2. Trigger-Based Escalation — risk breaches, unresolved deviations, incident activations.
3. Role-Based Pathways — tiered response mapped to functions.
4. Governance Integration — audit trail, review, accountability chain.
